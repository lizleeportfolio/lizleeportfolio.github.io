		<h2>About</h2>
		<img src="images/Me.jpg" alt="me">
		<p>Born and raised in Boston, I went to Northeastern University to study Communications and Spanish. Shortly after graduation, I started my career working for M|C Communications, a company that held continuing medical education conferences where I traveled nation-wide to set up and organize conferences. Our Marketing materials were written and proofed in-house, but the design was outsourced to a vendor. I wanted to become invovled with the creative aspect, and found an opportunity to join the Marketing team at Partners HealthCare. During this time we went through a website redesign which exposed me to the process of designing a website in a large organization from the discovery process, through content creation, design, testing and launch.</p>
		<p>In 2009 I got my Digital Graphic Design certificate from New England Institute for Art, which enabled me to create graphics for the website as well as print collateral. I continue to expand my skills through taking on new projects at work as well learning in my free time and taking interactive and design classes at Massachusetts College of Art.</p>
